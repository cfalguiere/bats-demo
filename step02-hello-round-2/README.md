# Unit testing Hello World with Bats - Round 2

Now it's OK, what additionnal tests do I need ?


<br>

## Question time

- Does it wotk for another name (just in case Alice were hardcoded) ?
- Does it wotk for composite names ?
- What do I expect when this script is called without parameter ?

I ended up with a new test file [here](hello-world-test.bats).
